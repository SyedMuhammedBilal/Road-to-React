<h1>React: Use a Ternary Expression for Conditional Rendering</h1>

Before moving on to dynamic rendering techniques, there's one last way to use built-in JavaScript conditionals to render what you want: the ternary operator. The ternary operator is often utilized as a shortcut for <code>if/else</code> statements in JavaScript. They're not quite as robust as traditional <code>if/else</code> statements, but they are very popular among React developers. One reason for this is because of how JSX is compiled, <code>if/else</code> statements can't be inserted directly into JSX code. You might have noticed this a couple challenges ago â€” when an <code>if/else</code> statement was required, it was always outside the return statement. Ternary expressions can be an excellent alternative if you want to implement conditional logic within your JSX. Recall that a ternary operator has three parts, but you can combine several ternary expressions together. Here's the basic syntax:

<code>condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;</code>
